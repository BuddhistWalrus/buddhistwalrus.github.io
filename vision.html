      <h4 style="font-family: Fantasy;">What I believe</h4>

                <p>Our world is in desperate need of innovative and passionate leaders! I plan on being one of them.</p>
                
                <p>Coding is important because it liberates you. Learning how to code a program not only teaches you how to logically structure and execute your thoughts, it goes a step further by allowing any person with an idea to become a Creator. We are living in a transforming world that is becoming increasingly connected on a global scale through the Internet and technology in general. The Internet is an open forum of communication that has simplified and enhanced the human life exponentially since its genesis. It removes externalities that could stop a genius idea from being actualized, like access to resources, and provides equal opportunity to everyone. In this way, coding and technology open countless doors for the passionate Creator, no matter who they are or where they come from.</p>

            <div class="colRight">
      <h4 style="font-family: Fantasy;">What WE can do TOGETHER</h4>
                <p>Every single one of us has the power to change the world if we set our minds to it. I believe that it is every person's responsibility to MAKE and BE the change they want to see in the world. The only real obstacle that stands in the way is our own doubt! In this new age of technology and communication the PEOPLE finally have a chance to make real lasting impact on the world.</p>
                <p>Every so often, a person or group of people, with unbridled ambition, will realize that what is going on around them is wrong and needs to change. No matter what the situation is, whether it be something as simple as a young boy cleaning his room or hundreds of thousands of human beings marching down the streets screaming for equality, these ambitious people end up changing the world in some way through their actions. </p>
                <p>Sometimes though, those with the best ideas and the most drive for success do not have the resources to do it all on their own. So they reach out to others for help, because with cooperation, anything is possible.</p>
