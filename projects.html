            <p>The Family ToolKit App for iPhone and Android is a project that I am working on with Dartmouth Graduate School professor Gregory Slayton.</p>
            <p>I developed a fully functioning C program that automatically solves mazes of different sizes and shapes and then provides a graphical representation in real-time of the solution. The maze can handle 2 to 8 players and is considered "solved" when all of the players are standing on the same maze coordinate. Players communicate to each other through a simple server that I constructed. The project can be found here</p>

            <p>DenTECH: I started a "Living Learning Community" at Dartmouth that focuses on technological entreperneurship and solving social problems via technology. What is a Living Learning Community you ask? Essentially I and 14 other dedicated students live and work together in the same dorm for the course of the year and are advised and funded by the faculty in an effort to make a difference in our field of choice. DenTECH will blossom in the fall and grow from there. We are starting our first project for a publishing group at Dartmouth in an effort to create an online, interactive, FREE magazine.  </p>
